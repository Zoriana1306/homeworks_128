                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you&apos;re looking for environment setup <br> 
                    instructions, they&apos;ve moved to span <span class="underline">their own section.</span> Continue reading for an introduction to the <br>

                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and <br>
                    the app platform&apos;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform&apos;s <br>
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="pt_sans_italic">bundles <br>
                    of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let&apos;s cover <br>
                    how components work in React Native.

                <h2>react fundamentals<sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
                <p>React Native runs on <span class="underline">React,</span> a popular open source library for building user interfaces with <br>
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get <br>
                    you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p><span class="pt_sans_bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, <br>
                    approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p><span class="pt_sans_bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:  <br>
                    <span class="bg-color">&lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;Hello, I am your cat!&lsaquo;/Text&rsaquo;.</span></p>
                <p>The React docs have a <span class="underline">comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is <br>
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="bg-color">name</span> for the cat, name, and <br>
                    embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="bg-color">&lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;</span></p>
                <p><span class="pt_sans_bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for &rdquo;properties&rdquo;.</p>
                <p><span class="pt_sans_bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, <br>
                    state is like a component&apos;s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br>
                    time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

            <!-- chapter 4 -->
            <article>
                <h2>handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="pt_sans_italic">onChangeText</span> prop that <br>
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a <br>
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p>For example, let&apos;s say that as the user types, you&apos;re translating their words into a different language. <br>
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence &rdquo;Hello there <br>
                    Bob" would be translated as &rdquo;üçï üçï&rdquo;.</p>
